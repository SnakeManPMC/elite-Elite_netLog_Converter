# elite-Elite_netLog_Converter

Converts Elite netLog system entries to a system + UTC time list in text file.

Basically Elite Log tool had only been used since January 3rd 2015 and I was missing everything from Elite Gamma v1.0 release Nov 22nd 2014 (last save game wipe). So this tool quickly converts all old netLog system jumps into Elit Log readatable text file list :)
